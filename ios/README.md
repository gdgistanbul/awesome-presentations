### <a name="sharing"></a> John Sundell - Sharing 

One of the best things about being a developer these days is the awesome communities that are built up around the technologies we work with. Whether you’re an iOS or Android developer, there’s always blogs to read, open source to use and conferences to attend. But getting started contributing to the community yourself, and sharing parts of your own work, is not always easy (in fact, it can be quite scary!). In this talk, John will talk about his experiences (and share lots of tips!) of starting a blog, a podcast, working on open source and sharing work in other ways.
