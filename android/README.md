### <a name="lyla"></a> Building an Android Instant App

Users don't like to wait. By shrinking your APK size, they won't need to. Smaller APKs not only provide faster downloads for users, but the refactoring process often simplifies your codebase. This simplification process prepares your app for Android Instant Apps, which can be opened from URLs and provide a native app experience without the friction of a full install. In this video, Lyla Fujiwara and Anirudh Dewani cover the many tools available to cut down your APK size, modularize your app, and build your first Android Instant App.
