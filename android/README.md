### <a name="lyla"></a> Building an Android Instant App

Users don't like to wait. By shrinking your APK size, they won't need to. Smaller APKs not only provide faster downloads for users, but the refactoring process often simplifies your codebase. This simplification process prepares your app for Android Instant Apps, which can be opened from URLs and provide a native app experience without the friction of a full install. In this video, Lyla Fujiwara and Anirudh Dewani cover the many tools available to cut down your APK size, modularize your app, and build your first Android Instant App.

### <a name="kotlin"></a> How to Kotlin - from the Lead Kotlin Language Designer (Google I/O '18)

Kotlin is similar to the Java programming language, so it's natural that your Kotlin code looks very much like Java code when you are first start to use the language. While this is fine to begin with, you're probably not taking full advantage of all the language benefits. In this session, the lead Kotlin language designer will show you how you can write more idiomatic Kotlin, what the benefits are, and help you discover some of the most powerful yet lesser known features of Kotlin.
